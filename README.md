# microdust_sensor
small python script using the readings of a SDS011 sensor to post them to a free adafruit feed
Before getting started on the code, we also need
to set up a data repository. You can store your data
wherever you like – on the SD card, or upload it to
some cloud service. We’ve opted to upload it to
Adafruit IO, an online service for storing data and
making dashboards. You’ll need a free account,
which you can sign up to at io.adafruit.com – you’ll
need to know your Adafruit username, two empty feeds and your Adafruit
IO key in order to run the code below. If you’d rather
use a different service, you’ll need to adjust the code
to push your data there.
